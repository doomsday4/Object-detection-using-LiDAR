# Object-detection-using-LiDAR
This is the implementation of the Voxelnet algorithm to detect 3D objects using point cloud data, image data and calibration using a LiDAR sensor. 
The Voxelnet.ipynb file is the process from downloading the Kitti Dataset to cropping it to fit our current algorithm using the crop.py file.
Note- We need to make sure we change the directories in the python file, according to our local machines, before running the code.
